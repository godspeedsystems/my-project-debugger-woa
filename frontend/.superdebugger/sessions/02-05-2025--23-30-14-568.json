      "content": "To write funny class names for your code, you can follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Start with a descriptive prefix that represents the purpose or functionality of the class.\n2. Add an adjective to describe the specific behavior or characteristics of the class.\n3. Include a noun related to the concept or domain the class operates in.\n4. Use a pun or play on words for added humor.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```typescript\n// Prefix: `fetch` represents data retrieval\nclass FetchData {\n  // Adjective: `Fast` indicates quick response time\n  class FastDataFetcher {}\n  \n  // Noun: `API` refers to the source of data\n  class APIDataHandler {}\n\n  // Pun: `Stream` implies a continuous flow of data\n  class DataStreamProcessor {}\n}\n\n// Prefix: `search` represents searching or querying\nclass SearchQuery {\n  // Adjective: `Advanced` for complex queries\n  class AdvancedSearchEngine {}\n  \n  // Noun: `Results` represent the output of the search\n  class SearchResultManager {}\n\n  // Pun: `Path` implies navigating through data structures\n  class DataPathFinder {}\n}\n```\n\nRemember to keep your class names meaningful and consistent with the rest of your codebase. The goal is to make the code more readable and self-explanatory while adding a touch of humor.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance or have any specific requirements for your class names!",

This includes system details, project path, structure, dependencies, git status, package info, and filtered environment variables.\n\nOverall, the `ProjectContextGatherer` class provides a comprehensive view of the current project's context, which can be useful for troubleshooting and understanding the project's state at any given time.",
